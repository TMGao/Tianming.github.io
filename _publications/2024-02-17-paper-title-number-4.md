The autonomou underwater vehicle (AUV) is an essential tool for exploring the ocean. However, the harsh marine environment makes full autonomy control unable to perform complex tasks. This paper employs Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) to design an underwater teleoperation system, mainly including master human operator, buoy, slave AUV and communication network. Based on this, an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) based teleoperation controller is developed, through which operator can remotely determine the motion of slave AUV via the master unit. Finally, simulation and experiments with different scenarios both verify the effectiveness of our solution.
